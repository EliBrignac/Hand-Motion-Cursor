# Hand-Motion-Cursor
Computer Vision tool that lets you use hand visuals to control your mouse. Watch the video below to see how when I move my hand, the pointer on my screen moves as well

# Video Demonstration
The video demonstration shows off what you can do by navigating throughout my GitHub. You can left click, right click, drag, drop, and scroll throught the page with you hand. You can see the gestures and what they do in the camera on the right.

# Default Position

The default position is similar to how you would normally point to something. Have your index finger up, and your thumb relaxed. This allows you to move across the screen without inputing any commands. The joint that is tracked to move your cursor is the Pip joint of your index finger highlighted by a red dot.


# Left Click

To left click, just pinch your index finger and thumb together and release. If you hold down, then you will click multiple times.


# Right CLick

To right click, you need to extend you pinky upwards, and keep it up there until you select your desired action. If you do not keep it extended, then the first action you hover over will be clicked on.


# Scroll

In order to scroll, you extend your pointer and middle finger upwards and extend your thumb out to the side. Imagine you are showing the camera an L. You can move your hand up, down, left, and right in order to scroll throught the screen however you please. To stop scrolling resort to the default position.


# Drag

To drag, pinch with your middle finger and thumb. Once you have grabed your item, keep your fingers pinched together as you move the item. Once you have placed it where you want it, resort back to the Default position and your item will be droped.
